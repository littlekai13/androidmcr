Music character recognition for Android phones.  The user takes a photo of sheet music with her camera phone, and the application will play the sheet music.  We are using OpenOMR to do the recognition.

Current status: basic GUI screen.  "Load photo from library..." button will get a photo handle and move to a new view for photo processing.  Photo processing not yet implemented.
