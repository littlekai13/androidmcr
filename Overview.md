# The Basic Plan #
  1. Basic GUI
  1. Figure out how to use OpenMCR and separate out the parts of the application we need
  1. Server-side implementation of OpenMCR to test the GUI
  1. Get a basic phone port set up; handle dependency issues
  1. Test the phone port and look for potential points of optimization
  1. Add usability features: e.g., save/e-mail the recording

# Optional, depending on results and progress #
  * Look into doing feature recognition on the phone & other half on server
  * Compare beat of playing music to beat of MIDI
  * Make a super fancy looking GUI
  * Metronome

# Current Progress #
  * Adrienne currently working on basic GUI
  * Cynthia starting on the basic phone port of OpenMCR & dependency issues
  * Vera reading about how neural networks work
